The player then makes a bet on one of the following three outcomes to happen: the next card (one of the 51 cards left in the deck), which will be chosen randomly, will be a) HIGHER, b) LOWER, or c) EQUAL in rank to the first card drawn from the deck by the player. Suits are matter in this game. If the player guesses the outcome, he or she will win the bet multiplied by the odds which depend on the card and the outcome chosen by the player.
